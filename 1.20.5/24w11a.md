predicate advancement loot | Removed the `any` entity sub predicate in `type_specific`.

command predicate | Added slot name `contents` for entities like items, item frames, and item displays.

predicate advancement loot breaking | Changed item predicates. Replaced some fields with item sub predicates, which is a map in field `predicates`:
* `durability` -> `damage` sub predicate, with two fields: `damage` and `durability`
* `enchantments` -> `enchantments` sub predicate
* `stored_enchantments` -> `stored_enchantments` sub predicate
* `potions` -> `potion_contents` sub predicate
* `custom_data` -> `custom_data` sub predicate

loot item-modifier | Added function `set_fireworks`, which has fields `flight_duration` (optional int), and `explosions` (optional list of explosions), and `mode` (list operation).

loot item-modifier | Added function `set_firework_explosion`, which has optional fields `shape` (string), `colors` (list of integers), `fade_colors` (list of integers), `trail` (boolean), and `twinkle` (boolean).

loot item-modifier | Added function `set_book_cover`, which has optional fields `title` (filterable string), `author` (string), `generation` (integer).

loot item-modifier | Added function `set_writable_book_pages`, which has fields `page` (list of filterable strings), and `mode` (list operation).

loot item-modifier | Added function `set_written_book_pages`, which has fields `page` (list of filterable strings containing text components), and `mode` (list operation).

loot item-modifier | Added list operations, which are used in some loot functions. They have a field `mode`:
* `append`: no additional fields
* `insert`: with optional field `offset` (integer)
* `replace_all`: no additional fields
* `replace_section`: with optional fields `offset` (integer) and `size` (integer)

assets shader breaking | Renamed post processing shader `blur` -> `box_blur`. Added new `entity_outline_box_blur` shader.

assets shader | Changed post processing passes. Added optional field `use_linear_filter` (boolean). When set to `true`, switches texture sampling mode from nearest-neighbor sampling to linear interpolation for that pass.
