* `[damage]` can be used to check if a component exists
* `[predicate~value]` can be used to check item sub predicates (not available for all components)
* `[count=4]` is a special case for matching the item stack count
* `[!count=1]`, `[!damage]` any entry can be negated by prepending a `!`
* `[!damage|damage=0]` tests can be joined with `|` to match alternatives
* removed the special behavior for custom data: `item{a:2}` -> `item[custom_data~{a:2}]`
