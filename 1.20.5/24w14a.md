pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to 38.

jar | The game now requires Java 21 and a 64-bit operating system.

loot item-modifier | Changed function `set_attributes`. Added optional field `replace` (boolean), which defaults to `true`.

loot item-modifier component | The `text` field in filterable has been renamed to `raw` to avoid ambiguity. Note this is not the same `text` field in text components.

block item nbt component | The `profile` component and field on items and blocks now supports resolving by UUID, when the `id` field is specified, but `name` is not.
